# Progress

## Current

Status: done
Task: Stabilize release-aware installation and provenance: `install.sh --ref=<tag|sha>` installs an immutable GitHub archive with no fallback, records `.agent-md/install-provenance.json`, and doctor reports it.
Risk: high

## Scope

- install.sh
- .agent-md/bin/doctor.sh
- README.md
- README.pt-BR.md
- tests/install-provenance.bats
- tests/install.bats
- memory/progress.md

## Next

- Next separate task: Publish v1.0.0-rc2. README Quickstart and install.sh already name that tag; the stable command only works once it is published.
- Separate observation: full verify.sh took 522-744s against the 750s per-check limit; harden only if it keeps reproducing.

## Blockers

None

## Recently Completed

- Stabilize release-aware installation and provenance: `install.sh --ref=<tag|full sha>` fetches archive/refs/tags/<tag> or archive/<sha> with no fallback and conflicts with source overrides; `.agent-md/install-provenance.json` (source, ref, sanitized source_url, archive-declared commit, no timestamp); doctor reports it and never fails without it; README Stable/Development. 24 new tests. Active 91ad8aa0f94b8c892634289120b407c9b14473c8 (CI 40169461124) and verifying 16799f880c81f5040ab9155d6d1eb859ca525770 (CI 40170800783) each passed normal hooks, all four CI jobs and exact-SHA independent verification.
- ENROLLMENT-SOURCE-ELIGIBILITY-1: /.agent/ is now ignored by the repository itself, so the authority (no global Git config) no longer enumerates hook scratch; its identity of this repo went from invalid (9 nested repos) to valid. Active f26f48c8c00bf5ec2814f73823e84f194927c8d2 (CI 40013382466) and verifying 4f1131d98ac0428b59a2e4aa79b1879ea5bc90a0 (CI 40015895471) each passed normal hooks, all four CI jobs and exact-SHA independent verification.
- CAC-STATE-PROGRESS-DELETION-1: under the gitignored-progress mtime fallback a staged deletion (index D) uses HEAD commit time as its floor instead of counting as an unexplained missing source; 8 regressions. Active checkpoint 6c38060ee0b411ced231ecee1e38f99a068ca388 (CI 39999627723) and verifying checkpoint 801c13658a625d8dd7fb91ae6547a3f897cd5496 (CI 40002584968) each passed normal hooks, all four CI jobs and exact-SHA independent verification.
- Owner approved v1.0.0-rc1 based on readiness candidate 42499a8f23aedcc0cf6f929677f633745fbf688d, with zero concrete blockers. The published tag must target the final done operational descendant, not necessarily this original candidate.
- Accepted nonblocking limitations: Claude orphan lifecycle records until confirmed termination; SubagentStart cannot block creation after registration failure; directive budget/truncation hardening; local authority without linked worktrees; staged issuance unsupported.
